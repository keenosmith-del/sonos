# How It Works

* Application state (user, cart, login status) is stored in localStorage
* React Router handles navigation between pages
* Cart logic ensures:

  * Identical products with the same variation increase quantity
  * Different variations are treated as separate items
* UI updates dynamically based on user interaction
